# Acerola Jam 0 submission: A&FCFI

Working Title: Aberration and the Futility of Change and Fighting It

Iunno jam game.

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to record changes.

### Super secret for me

```sh
pijul add -r .
pijul rec <whatever>
...
stg add -A
stg new -r <name>
stg commit
```

We don't use git directly, b/c git is more of a distribution mechanism
for this project than a VCS
