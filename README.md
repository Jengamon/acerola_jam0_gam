# Attempt at Acerola Jam 0

An attempt to make a game, I didn't finish it, and now I might put around with
the idea in an attempt to complete it, but that probably isn't happening any time soon.

I do think some things here are cool:
- understanding Bevy was 1000% cool, and I might do smaller projects in it to get gooder.
- the `fundsp_kira` and `simple_bt` modules are p useful and I might copy them for
other projects, where `fundsp_kira` only needs some spatial support and I have ideas for that,
and `simple_bt` is a self-contained thing.
